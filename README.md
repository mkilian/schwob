schwob
======

this project contains several implementations of the famous
schwobifier, written and improved by several people.

the javascript implementation (schwob.js) has been ported from the
original lex implemenation by Ralf Zabka and the webschwob patch
by Markus Demleitner.

note that i originally put webschwob.lex and schwob.js under RCS
version control (only one patch to webschwob.lex but the complete
history of schwob.js); i'll try to do a RCS->git conversion when
i've some spare time and feel too bored to do anything else.
